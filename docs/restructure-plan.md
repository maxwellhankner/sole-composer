# Project Restructuring Plan

## Goals
1. Simplify project structure
2. Follow React best practices
3. Improve code organization and maintainability
4. Make the codebase easier to understand and navigate

## Client-Side Restructuring

### New Directory Structure

    client/
    ├── src/
    │   ├── assets/          # Static assets, images, etc.
    │   ├── components/      # Reusable UI components
    │   │   ├── common/      # Shared components like Button, Input, etc.
    │   │   └── designer/    # Shoe designer specific components
    │   ├── hooks/           # Custom React hooks
    │   ├── context/         # React context providers
    │   ├── features/        # Feature-based modules
    │   │   └── designer/    # All designer-related logic and components
    │   ├── services/        # API and external service integrations
    │   ├── utils/           # Helper functions and utilities
    │   ├── styles/          # Global styles and theme
    │   ├── config/          # Configuration files
    │   └── App.jsx         # Root component

### Current Structure Analysis
Based on the files we can see, we currently have:
- `containers/Designer/` - Main designer logic
- `components/DesignerContainer/` - Designer UI components
- `utils/canvasFunctions/` - Canvas-related utilities
- `UserProvider.jsx` - User context provider

### Phase 1: Initial Reorganization
1. Move files to new structure:
   - `UserProvider.jsx` → `src/context/UserContext.jsx`
   - `containers/Designer/` → `src/features/designer/`
   - `components/DesignerContainer/` → `src/features/designer/components/`
   - `utils/canvasFunctions/` → `src/features/designer/utils/`

### Phase 2: Component Separation
1. Identify and extract common components
2. Create proper component hierarchy
3. Implement proper prop types and documentation

### Phase 3: Feature Organization
1. Organize designer feature:
   - Move business logic to custom hooks
   - Separate 3D rendering logic
   - Create proper state management
   - Implement proper error handling

### Phase 4: Testing & Documentation
1. Set up testing infrastructure
2. Write component tests
3. Update documentation
4. Create component usage examples

## Implementation Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. Create new directory structure
2. Move existing files to their new locations
3. Update import paths
4. Test functionality after each move

### Short-term Goals
1. Separate business logic from UI components
2. Implement proper error boundaries
3. Add loading states
4. Create reusable components

### Long-term Goals
1. Consider TypeScript implementation
2. Add comprehensive testing
3. Implement code splitting
4. Improve performance optimization

## Notes
- Keep existing functionality working during migration
- Test thoroughly after each file move
- Update documentation as we progress
- Consider adding proper TypeScript support in the future 

## Restructuring Guidelines
1. Minimize Code Changes
   - Focus on moving files and updating imports
   - Avoid rewriting existing logic unless absolutely necessary
   - Keep component internals unchanged during initial restructure
   - Document areas that need refactoring for future phases
   
2. Step-by-Step Process
   - Move one file/component at a time
   - Test after each move
   - Only update import paths and essential exports
   - Keep original file structure in features/designer initially
   - Gradually improve organization within each feature

3. What to Avoid
   - Rewriting working code
   - Changing component logic during moves
   - Premature optimization
   - Breaking existing functionality

4. Future Improvements
   - Create list of technical debt for later phases
   - Mark areas that need refactoring
   - Document patterns that should change eventually
   - Plan incremental improvements after restructure
